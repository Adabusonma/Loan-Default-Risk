# Loan Default Risk Prediction 

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a borrower will default on a loan. This project demonstrates how data science can be applied in financial risk management — from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to model building, evaluation, and deployment.

# Project Overview

Financial institutions face major challenges in assessing loan default risk. Traditional credit scoring methods often miss subtle behavioral patterns that signal potential default.
This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to predict loan default, enabling better credit decisions, minimizing financial losses, and improving portfolio quality.

Key Goals:

- Identify high-risk borrowers before loan approval.

- Improve prediction accuracy using behavioral + financial data.

- Build a deployment-ready pipeline for real-time loan risk assessment.

# Problem Statement

Develop a classification model that predicts loan default risk using customer demographic, performance, and historical loan data.

The target variable is:

- good_bad_flag = 1 → Loan repaid (Good)

- good_bad_flag = 0 → Loan defaulted (Bad)

# Dataset

I worked with three datasets provided as .csv files:

- Performance Data (trainperf.csv
)

Loan performance records

Shape: 4,368 rows × 10 columns

- Demographics Data (traindemographics.csv
)

Borrower demographic details

Shape: 4,346 rows × 9 columns

- Previous Loans Data (trainprevloans.csv
)

Historical borrowing behavior

Shape: 18,183 rows × 12 columns

### Key Features:

- Loan Amount, Term Days, Interest Rate, Repayment Ratio

- Borrower Age, Employment Status, Bank Account Type

- Previous loan history & repayment patterns

# Approach

The workflow follows a full data science pipeline:

#### Data cleaning/Understanding

- Handled missing values (imputation & dropping when >80%).

- Converted date fields to datetime.

- Removed duplicates.

- Managed outliers .

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized loan amounts, terms, repayment ratios, and demographics.

- Identified patterns in repayment burden, default behavior, and age distributions.

#### Feature Engineering
I Created meaningful new features, including:

- Customer Age (loan creation date – birthdate)

- Late Payment Rate (% of past loans paid late)

- Repayment Efficiency Ratio (amount repaid ÷ amount due)

#### Class Imbalance Handling

- Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance defaulters vs non-defaulters.

#### Modeling
I trained and evaluated multiple models:

- Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable, strong performance)

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting

- XGBoost

- LightGBM

#### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

- ROC AUC

- Confusion Matrix

# Deployment

I built a Streamlit web app: Loan Default Risk Predictor where users can enter borrower + loan details to get real-time risk predictions.
It is fully deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy public access and testing:

# Key Insights

- Loan amounts are clustered around ₦10,000–₦15,000 → mostly small, short-term loans.

- Most borrowers are young (25–40 years) and relatively new (1–3 previous loans).

- Repayment ratios cluster between 78%–88%, but full repayment is rare.

- Late Payment Rate is the strongest predictor of default.

- Logistic Regression outperformed more complex models, achieving higher recall (catching more true defaulters).

# Results

Best Model: Logistic Regression

Reason: High recall for default cases (critical for minimizing loan losses), interpretability, and alignment with business goals.

After Hyperparameter Tuning:

Recall for defaulters improved from 51% → 55%

False Negatives reduced, meaning fewer missed defaulters → direct financial savings.

# Business Implications

- By catching more potential defaulters, the bank can save millions in avoided losses.

- False positives (good borrowers wrongly flagged) represent lost opportunities, but far less costly than missed defaults.

- Transparent models like Logistic Regression improve trust with regulators and credit officers.

- With income data (missing here), predictions could become even stronger.
